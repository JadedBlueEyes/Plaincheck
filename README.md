## Development

To set up your environment to develop Plaincheck, run `bundle install`. It's now ready for any edits and testing you want!

To test it, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and open your browser at `http://localhost:4000`. This starts a local server.

Remember: When the theme is released, only the files in `_layouts`, `_includes`, `_sass` and `assets` tracked with Git will be bundled.
To add a custom directory to the gem, please edit the regexp in `Plaincheck.gemspec` accordingly.
